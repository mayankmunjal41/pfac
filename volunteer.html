      </div>
      <h1>VOLUNTEER</h1>
      <h4 class="font-italic">Who can volunteer?</h4>

      <p>Anyone willing to dedicate their time, effort and energy towards changing lives is
welcome into our team! Timely and regular action is the only pre-requisite.</p>

      <h4 class="font-italic">How do volunteers work?</h4>

      <p>We do not run a shelter or center so we do not require your physical presence every
day. Most of our work is done virtually, so volunteers need to be both tech savvy and
regularly responsive online.</p>

      <h4 class="font-italic">What kind of volunteer can you be?</h4>

      <p>You can volunteer for more than one role depending on your ability to contribute.</P>

      	<h4 class="font-italic"> Adoption Coordinator</h4>
        	<p class="custom-border">	Every coordinator is assigned 3 cases on average, wherein they are responsible for
            finding homes for the animals allotted. </p>
        	<p class="custom-border">   The coordinator would be the point of contact between the potential adopting family
             and the rescuer/shelter. Maintaining regular communication on both fronts is crucial. </p>
        	<p class="custom-border">	Coordinators need to actively work in the following manner:
            <ul class="custom-border">
              <li>Retain details of the cases they are working on from the rescuer/shelter. This would
involve history of the dog, temperament, vaccination, sterilization and de-worming
status, etc.</li>
              <li>Ensure availability of professional photographs of the dogs to go up on the PfaC
Facebook page by contacting photography volunteers.</li>
              <li>Regular posting of the photos along with a detailed write-up on our social media
platforms.</li>
              <li>Following up with interested parties in a timely manner and carrying out the adoption
procedure strictly, assistance with which will be provided by an assigned supervisor.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>


      	<h4 class="font-italic"> House Check Volunteer </h4>
        <p class="custom-border">The volunteer will be asked to conduct house checks primarily
           in and around the area they reside in.</p>
        <p class="custom-border"> They play an important role in explaining the specific needs of the dog as well as answering
         any questions the potential adopters may have. Post this, a house check report is to be sent to
         PfaC which would enable us to determine suitability of the adoption request.</p>



        	<h4 class="font-italic">	Social Media Volunteer</h4>
        	<p class="custom-border">	This involves managing our Facebook page, Instagram account and website.</p>
        	<p class="custom-border">	The volunteer will be responsible for maintaining the quality of the content which goes
            up on our online platforms.</p>
        	<p class="custom-border">	The volunteer will also have to maintain the schedule of our online posts and coordinate
            with all team members.</p>

      	<h4 class="font-italic"> Photographer or Designer </h4>
      	<p class="custom-border">	The photographer will be responsible to taking photographs of dogs which need to be posted
          for adoption as well as events organized by PfaC.</p>
      	<p class="custom-border">	The services of a graphic designer would be required to help create designs for the
          posters/images that go up on our social media platforms as well as our merchandise that is
           sold to raise funds for our cases.</p>


        <p>All our volunteers work pro bono- Paws for a Cause functions solely on donations and we are
therefore unable to pay our volunteers.</p>

        <p>Before volunteering, we ask people to remember that this is actual work, not a past time. We
function as an adoption agency and help change lives, so we are only looking for people who
are dedicated and understand that as an adoption coordinator, some time is needed
every day to work on their cases.p>

        <h6 class="font-italic">Recruitment form link: <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/mfBjDodMkUVk1D632" target="_blank">https://goo.gl/forms/mfBjDodMkUVk1D632</a></h6>

<p>We add people every two months so hearing back may take some time. Volunteers are
recruited based on their form responses so please give them proper thought.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

              <h6> Which shelters does Paws for a Cause collaborate with? </h6>
      <p>While our primary aim is to help independent rescuers with adoptions,
         we also collaborate with the following shelters:<br>
            -Animal Hospital & Shelter, Noida<br>
            -Umeed the Rehabilitation Centre, Gurgaon<br>
            -Sanjay Gandhi Animal Care Centre, Raja Garden<br>
            -All Creatures Great & Small, Faridabad<br>
            -Sonadi Charitable Trust, Najafgarh</p>

      <h6>Can I foster a dog? What is the minimum number of days for fostering?</h6>

      <p>In order to foster a dog, you need to fill in our adoption/foster form.
         Please get in touch with the coordinator of the dog you wish to foster.
          A house check will be conducted following which you can foster that dog
          if the environment and experience of the foster is deemed suitable. A dog
          must be fostered for a minimum of 10 days, and a foster contract committing
          to this time period must be signed.</p>

      <h6> Does Age Matter? </h6>

           <p>No. The age of a dog does not decide whether they will make good companion animals.
           Some things to keep in mind are:</p>

           <p>1. Pups under 8 weeks of age should not be separated from their mother or siblings.
            They require breast milk to develop a strong immune system and also learn several
             important social skills from their mother and siblings.</p>

           <p>2. Adult dogs bond with adoptive families extremely well. It is a misconception that an adult dog would be aloof and only pups must be adopted.  </p>

           <p>3. Senior dogs make wonderful companions. They are usually gentle, low maintenance and can be left alone for some time every day. Most importantly, you would be giving them a respectful last few years of their life.</p>


      <h6>Can I meet a dog I’m interested in adopting?</h6>

      <p>Once the form has been filled and house check conducted, you are free to visit the dogs you are interested in adopting.</p>

      <h6>Do you also conduct rescues or ABC operations?</h6>

      <p>We function as an adoption agency, and therefore we do not conduct rescues as we do not run a shelter or centre. We also have no medical facilities or transportation van. However we will guide you on who to contact and what to do depending on the situation.</p>

      <h6> Is sterilization mandatory?</h6>

      <p>Sterilization is mandated as per our adoption contract. All shelters we work with also deem sterilization mandatory.</p>

      <h6> Do you charge an adoption fee?</h6>

      <p>While Paws for a Cause does NOT charge an adoption fee, some of the shelters we work with do charge a nominal amount. We do however function on donations, and would be grateful if anyone chooses to donate!</p>

      <h6> If I want to put my dog up for adoption, can I contact you?</h6>

      <p>You can contact us on Facebook or through our e-mail ID to discuss the situation with us.</p>

      <h6>Are rescuers allowed to be in touch with adopters?</h6>

      <p>This depends on the comfort of both the family that is adopting and the rescuer of the dog.</p>

      <h6> How long does it take for a dog to find a home?</h6>

      <p>We cannot guarantee adoptions within any specific time frame though we try our best to ensure no dog goes without a home for long. Purebred dogs, males, and young indie pups tend to get adopted faster due to breed, gender, and age biases.</p>

              <p>Paws for a Cause is partnered with the International Street Dog Foundation (ISDF),
              Chicago to facilitate international adoptions of Desi dogs. We keep these as an absolute
              last resort because travelling abroad requires aggressive fundraising, tedious paperwork and
              training for the dog being sent.</p> <p>  We realise that these funds can be used elsewhere to help
              multiple other dogs but sometimes it's the only option we're left with. We see strong biases
              against Indies, especially if they're 6+ months old and are female.</p>
