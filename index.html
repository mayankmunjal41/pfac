           <p>Paws for a Cause is an animal welfare initiative by young people in Delhi who have
           chosen to combine their work as animal rescuers or adoptions coordinators under a common platform.

           loving forever homes.
          </p>
          <p>The process of adoption can be lengthy and difficult so our goal

        <h6>What is the difference between adopting and buying?</h6>

        <p>Adoption is a process by which dogs who are incapable of surviving on the streets by
themselves or have been abandoned by their families are given a second chance at a
comfortable life. Shopping is a process where dogs are bought from breeders, who
repeatedly exploit them for money.</p>

        <p>When you adopt a companion animal, you are saving a life. You know the health and
behavioural traits of the dog you are taking home. You are allowing a shelter or rescuer
to make space for another dog to be helped and saved.</p>

        <p>Most importantly, when you adopt you are not supporting the exploitation of a dog and
her puppies or the abusive cruelty of the breeding industry.</p>

        <h6>What happens when you buy a dog?</h6>

        <p>Puppy mills and breeders indulge in immoral activities, wherein the mother dog
           is repeatedly exploited for her reproductive organs and her puppies are sold off
           like commodities. In addition to this, most breeders in India indulge in these
            practices unlawfully and you would be supporting an illegal industry if you buy a
             puppy from them.</p>
        <p>The mother eventually dies out of trauma or is discarded after she cannot bear any
           more puppies. The puppies themselves are frequently unhealthy, and exposed to
            infections very early on. Many puppies that are bought die in the first two months
             after facing diseases like Parvovirus or Distemper. </p>
        <p>The pups are also removed from their mother too early and usually develop
           multiple health and behavioural problems later in life. Purebred puppies often
           have a host of genetic disorders specific to their breed.</p>


        <h6 class="myths">Common Myths!</h6>

        <p><strong>Myth:</strong> Rescued/ shelter dogs are aggressive and will be difficult to handle</p>
        <p><em>Fact:</em> Most of these dogs have usually been abandoned by and faced abuse from
irresponsible humans. Remember that being
abandoned does not mean that something is wrong with the dog- it means the family
that bought them initially gave up on them.</p>
        <p><strong>Myth:</strong> Older dogs/ cats will not bond with their new companions</p>
        <p><em>Fact:</em> Age is not a factor that determines whether animals with bond with people who
are new to them. The amount of affection given, the time spent, and the care provided,
will determine this. We have had adult and senior dogs adopted who adjusted with ease
into their new families.</p>
        <p><strong>Myth:</strong> Getting an animal from a breeder is safer because the breeder knows the
           animals bloodline and history</p>
        <p><em>Fact:</em> This is far from the truth. Pet stores and breeders indulge in exploitative breeding practices.
           They often fail to remove sick dogs from their breeding pools, as well as allow inbreeding
            to take place. This results in the puppies having many genetic diseases such as joint
            disorders, respiratory disorders, epilepsy, kidney and heart diseases.</p>

      <div class="modal-body indie-modal">
        <h6>Who are indies?</h6>
  <p>The Indian pariah dog is a dog breed native to India.</p>
  <p>Pariahs or any cross-breeds of pariahs and other dogs get classified as Indies.</p>
  <p>Indies have evolved through pure and simple 'survival of the fittest'. Without human interference, only the strongest and most intelligent of them have survived. </p>


  <h6>Why adopt an indie?</h6>

  <p>Indies are more resilient, hardy, and resistant to genetic health and behavioural
problems than most human created dog breeds. They are loving, friendly, intelligent,
and trainable.</p>
  <p>They are able to handle the drastic changes in the tropic Indian weather and are
adaptable to different surroundings. </p>
  <p>Indies only shed their coats minimally and do not require frequent visits to the groomer. </p>


  <h6>Problems with other breeds</h6>


  <p>Purebred dogs have been genetically modified to breed certain characteristics that appeal to 'buyers'.
  Pugs get major breathing issues, eye problems and skin diseases.
  Dachshunds and Dalmatians suffer from back issues.
  Labradors are prone to obesity, arthritis, and hip dysplasia.
  Golden retrievers have the highest likelihood of developing cancer. </p>



  <p>Dogs not meant for Indian climates need extra care in summer/winter.
  High air-conditioning or heating bills.
  The furry breeds tend to shed quite a bit and get lots of dog hair, especially in shedding season, all over your furniture. </p>

  <h6>Common Myths!</h6>

  <p><strong>Myth:</strong> Indies are aggressive</p>
  <p><em>Fact:</em> Dogs on the street are just protecting their territory and their lives from
     human intervention</p>

  <p><strong>Myth:</strong> They are strays hence can’t be domesticated.</p>
  <p><em>Fact:</em> All dogs are domesticated. Indies make wonderful companions, we have tons of
     photographs and live examples to prove that to you!</p>

      <div class="modal-body sterilize-modal">
        <h6>What is sterilization?</h6>

<p>The process of ‘de-sexing’ an animal by removing the productive organs is called
sterilization.</p>

<p>For female dogs, it means the removal of the ovaries/uterus.</p>

<p>For male dogs, it means the removal of the testicles and is also known as neutering.</p>

<h6>When should a dog be sterilized?</h6>

<p>The ideal time to sterilize a dog is before its first ‘heat’ period. That is when they have
grown to full maturity, but will not face any health issues that can occur if the first heat is
experienced.</p>

<p>In most dogs that is 6-8 months of age. In large breed dogs, adulthood is reached
between 1 and 1.5 years of age.</p>

 <p>The exact timing should be confirmed with your vet and is decided based on your dog’s
health and well-being. </p>

<h6>Why sterilize your dog? </h6>

<p>Unlike humans, dogs do not feel the need to mate emotionally. For them it is a purely
biological urge, and even a painful experience. The world does not need more
homeless dogs. </p>

<p>The responsible and moral thing to do as the parent to a companion
animal is to break the chain- instead of letting your dog create more puppies, adopt one
of the many dogs that is already alive and in need of a home.</p>

<p>Paws for a Cause mandates the sterilization of all dogs adopted through us.</p>

<h6> Common Myths! </h6>


<p><strong>Myth:</strong> Dogs gain weight after sterilization.</p>
<p><em>Fact:</em> They gain weight due to lack of exercise and overfeeding.
   With some simple adjustments to their diets, they will do just fine.</p>




<p><strong>Myth:</strong> It’s poses a risk to the overall and long-term health and well-being of
   the canine.</p>
<p><em>Fact:</em> A safe and simple surgery, which is important for the health and happiness of your
  canine companion. Like any other surgery, there are minor risks, but then the risk of losing your beloved
   companion to cancer is much higher.</p>

<h6>Can I foster a dog? What is the minimum number of days for fostering?</h6>

<p>In order to foster a dog, you need to fill in our adoption/foster form.
   Please get in touch with the coordinator of the dog you wish to foster.
    A house check will be conducted following which you can foster that dog
    if the environment and experience of the foster is deemed suitable. A dog
    must be fostered for a minimum of 10 days, and a foster contract committing
    to this time period must be signed.</p>

<h6> Does age matter? </h6>

     <p>No. The age of a dog does not decide whether they will make good companion animals.
     Some things to keep in mind are:</p>

    <p>1. Pups under 8 weeks of age should not be separated from their mother or siblings.
     They require breast milk to develop a strong immune system and also learn several
      important social skills from their mother and siblings.</p>

    <p>2. Adult dogs bond with adoptive families extremely well. It is a misconception that an adult dog would be aloof and only pups must be adopted.  </p>

    <p>3. Senior dogs make wonderful companions. They are usually gentle, low maintenance and can be left alone for some time every day. Most importantly, you would be giving them a respectful last few years of their life.</p>

<h6>Can I meet a dog I’m interested in adopting?</h6>

<p>Once the form has been filled and house check conducted, you are free to visit the dogs you are interested in adopting.</p>

<h6>Do you also conduct rescues or ABC operations?</h6>

<p>We function as an adoption agency, and therefore we do not conduct rescues as we do not run a shelter or centre. We also have no medical facilities or transportation van. However we will guide you on who to contact and what to do depending on the situation.</p>

<h6> Is sterilization mandatory?</h6>

<p>Sterilization is mandated as per our adoption contract. All shelters we work with also deem sterilization mandatory.</p>

<h6> Do you charge an adoption fee?</h6>

<p>While Paws for a Cause does NOT charge an adoption fee, some of the shelters we work with do charge a nominal amount. We do however function on donations, and would be grateful if anyone chooses to donate!</p>

<h6> If I want to put my dog up for adoption, can I contact you?</h6>

<p>You can contact us on Facebook or through our e-mail ID to discuss the situation with us.</p>

<h6>Are rescuers allowed to be in touch with adopters?</h6>

<p>This depends on the comfort of both the family that is adopting and the rescuer of the dog.</p>

<h6> How long does it take for a dog to find a home?</h6>

<p>We cannot guarantee adoptions within any specific time frame though we try our best to ensure no dog goes without a home for long. Purebred dogs, males, and young indie pups tend to get adopted faster due to breed, gender, and age biases.</p>

        <h6>PfaC has a rehoming partner in Vancouver to whom we send some of our very difficult cases. The following are some of the questions we are regularly asked, regarding international adoptions.</h6>
        <h6>Who is considered for an international adoption?</h6>
        <p>Desi dogs, 8+ months old. Dogs being sent abroad typically have features that make them somewhat unadoptable in India, these include biases against sex, typical Indie features, a limp in their legs, or a disability. A significant attempt should be made to find them a home in India before considering this option.</p>
        <h6>Who is our partner organization?</h6>
        <p>We send dogs to Loved at Last Dog Rescue (LALDR), based in Vancouver, Canada. Website: http://www.lovedatlastdogrescue.ca/</p>
        <h6>How long does the process take?</h6>
        <p>Once we approve a case for an international adoption, our partner organization starts looking for a home for the dog. This can take between 2-4 weeks. Simultaneously, the rescuer is expected to fundraise and send the dog abroad in 4-8 weeks.</p> 
        <h6>How much does it cost and why?</h6>
        <p>The major costs are divided into paperwork, crate, microchipping, boarding (unless the dog has a foster home), and flight costs. The total amount can range between 70,000 – 1,00,000 INR. The rescuer is reimbursed with a maximum fee of 400 CAD ( ~ 20,000 INR), once the dog has reached the destination.</p>
        <h6>Is it better to send a dog as excess baggage with a flight volunteer or in cargo hold?</h6>
        <p>Safety wise, it is exactly the same thing. The major benefit of having a flight volunteer is that it is much cheaper than cargo. </p>
        <h6>Which flights allow dogs?</h6>
        The rules and regulations are dynamic and it is advisable to call the airlines and check every time. 
        <h6>What will PfaC’s role be?</h6>
        <p>PfaC is the point of contact with our rehoming partner, LALDR. We will help the rescuer with finding a home for the dog abroad, and also with understanding and working out the logistics of travel. PfaC, in most cases, will also support fundraising by sharing fundraisers and with other innovative fundraising ideas. PfaC members will also try their best to find flight volunteers for the dog. Ultimately, the responsibility to raise funds lies with the rescuer, and whatever is not raised has to be paid for by the rescuer.</p>  <h6>Can we continue looking for a home for the dog in India during this process?</h6> <p>No. Once we have committed to sending a dog to LALDR, we have to do so.</p>
        <h6>Can we be in touch with the dog’s family post adoption?</h6>
        <p>Yes, LALDR provides PfaC with contact information of the adoptive and foster families for the dogs and we can remain in direct touch, if need be. PfaC will be the point of contact here. </p>
        <h6>Will the dog be put to sleep if they do not find a home?</h6>
        <p>No. We only send dogs once they have an approved adopter. In the event that the adoption fails, LALDR puts the dog in a foster. The dog will never be put in a shelter or be at the risk of euthanasia. </p>
