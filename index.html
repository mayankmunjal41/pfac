           <p>Paws for a Cause is an animal welfare initiative by young people in Delhi who have
           chosen to combine their work as animal rescuers or adoptions coordinators under a common platform.
           Our aim is to spread the word about homeless and abandoned companion animals who need
           loving forever homes.
          </p>
          <p>The process of adoption can be lengthy and difficult so our goal
           is to simplify things for those interested in it.

        <h6>WHAT ?</h6>

        <p>Adoption is a process by which dogs who are incapable of surviving on the                streets by themselves are provided with a home, love and care by some wonderful humans.
        Shopping is a process where dogs are bought from breeders.</p> <p> What people don’t realise is that majority of breeders use unethical practices in the breeding process, the mother of the puppies is often raped excessively and lives an extremely traumatized life. <br>The mother usually dies during childbirth or is inhumanly discarded after she cannot bear any more puppies. Due to irresponsible  inbreeding the puppies are extremely unhealthy, have a host of genetic diseases and usually develop multiple health problems later in life.</p>

        <h6>WHY YOU SHOULD ADOPT AND NOT SHOP ?</h6>

        <p>When you adopt a companion, you are saving a life</p>
        <p>When you adopt you have the choice of choosing the age of your pet</p>
        <p>When you adopt, you are consciously not supporting unethical and inhumane breeding practices
        When you adopt an animal, you are helping the shelter/ rescuer make space for other animals
        that need to be rescued </p>
        <p>Adoption is an act of kindness and you are sure to receive a
        lot of love from all the animals you adopt</p>


        <h6 class="myths">COMMON MYTHS!</h6>

        <p><strong>Myth:</strong> Rescued/ shelter dogs are aggressive and will be difficult to handle</p>
        <p><em>Truth:</em> These dogs have usually been abandoned by irresponsible owners and all they require is some love, patience and training.</p>
        <p><strong>Myth:</strong> Older dogs/ cats will not bond with their new companions</p>
        <p><em>Truth:</em> Completely untrue, age is not a factor that determines whether animals with bond with people who are new to them. The amount of affection given, the time spent and the care will determine this.</p>
        <p><strong>Myth:</strong> Getting an animal from a breeder is safer because the breeder knows the animals bloodline and history</p>
        <p><em>Truth:</em> This is far from the truth. Most puppy mills which supply pet stores with puppies and breeders, often are extremely irresponsible and ignorant about breeding practices. They often fail to remove sick dogs from their breeding pools, as well as allow inbreeding to take place. This results in the puppies having many genetic diseases such as respiratory disorders, epilepsy, kidney and heart diseases.</p>

        <h6>WHO ARE INDIES ?</h6>
  <p>Indian pariah dog, a dog breed native to India.</p>
  <p>Pariahs or any cross-breeds of pariahs and other dogs get classified as Indies.</p>
  <p>Indies have evolved through pure and simple 'survival of the fittest'. Without human interference, only the strongest and most intelligent of them have survived. </p>


  <h6>WHY INDIES ?</h6>

  <p>Indies are much more resilient, hardy, and resistant to most of the above problems.
  They are loving, friendly, intelligent and easily trainable.</p>
  <p>Ability to handle the tropical Indian weather, and their agility in adapting to their surroundings. </p>
  <p>They only shed their coats minimally and don't need too frequent groomer visits. </p>


  <h6>PROBLEMS WITH OTHER BREEDS</h6>


  <p>Purebred dogs have been genetically modified to breed certain characteristics that appeal to 'buyers'.
  Pugs get major breathing issues, eye problems and skin diseases.
  Dachshunds and Dalmatians suffer from back issues.
  Labradors are prone to obesity, arthritis, and hip dysplasia.
  Golden retrievers have the highest likelihood of developing cancer. </p>

  <p>Due to unregulated and poor breeding practices, a lot of purebred puppies are born with genetic diseases and chronic infections. </p>

  <p>Dogs not meant for Indian climates need extra care in summer/winter.
  High air-conditioning or heating bills.
  The furry breeds tend to shed quite a bit and get lots of dog hair, especially in shedding season, all over your furniture. </p>










  <h6>INDIAN BREEDS YOU NEVER HEARD ABOUT</h6>

  <p><strong>Chippiparai:</strong> Breed found in Tamil Nadu. They are symbol of royalty and dignity. </p>
  <p><strong>Indian Pariah Dog:</strong> An ancient breed, a relative of Dingo.</p>
  <p><strong>Caravan hound:</strong> Talk about one dog with multiple personalities also known                                                  as Mudhol Hound.</p>
  <p><strong>Rampur Hound:</strong> They are native to northern region, known for their endurance. </p>
  <p><strong>Indian Mastiff:</strong> Originated from India/Pakistan, they are tough in nature. Also known as Bully Kutta.</p>
  <p><strong<Gaddi:</strong> Native to Himalayn region, they are mastiff type dog breeds and are intelligent enough to be herd dogs. </p>

      <div class="modal-body sterilize-modal">
        <h6>WHAT IS STERILIZATION?</h6>

<p>The process of 'de-sexing' an animal is called sterilization.</p>

<p>For female dogs, it implies hysterectomy (removing the ovaries and uterus).</p>

<p>For male dogs, it means removal of the testicles. </p>

<h6>WHEN TO STERILIZE?</h6>

<p>The ideal time to sterilize a dog is just before their first 'heat' period - because that's when he/she is sexually mature and has grown to full maturity, but without any health issues arising from not sterilizing.</p>

 <p>The exact timing can be checked with your vet, based on the dog's health. </p>

<h6>WHY  STERILIZE?</h6>

<p>No chance of ovarian cysts, uterine infections, and cancer of the reproductive tract.
Female dogs spayed before their first heat have a much lower chance of developing breast cancer. <br>
There will be no heat cycles, so your female dog won't be howling in pain and making a 'mess' inside the house.</p>




<p>For male dogs, they have reduced chances of getting testicular cancer.
Your male dog will not tend to wander far away, or spray urine to mark territory, and be less aggressive and territorial.</p>






<p>Dogs don't NEED sex. For them, it's a purely biological urge and a painful experience.
The world does not need more homeless dogs. It's the responsible thing to do to break the chain, and not let your dog give birth to puppies that you will not be keeping.</p>







<h6> COMMON MYTHS! </h6>


<p><strong>Myth:</strong>: Dogs gain weight after sterilization.<br>
<em>Fact:</em> They gain weight due to lack of exercise and overfeeding. With some simple adjustments to their diets, they will do just fine.</p>




<p><strong>Myth:</strong> It’s poses a risk to the overall and long-term health and well-being of the canine.<br>
<em>Fact:</em>A safe and simple surgery, which is important for the health and happiness of your canine companion. Like any other surgery, there are minor risks, but then the risk of losing your beloved companion to cancer is much higher.</p>

      -All Creatures Great & Small.<br>

<h6>Can I foster a dog? What is the minimum number of days for fostering?</h6>

<p>In order to foster a dog, you need to fill in our adoption/foster form. Please get in touch with the coordinator of the dog you wish to foster. A house check will be conducted following which you can foster that dog if the environment and experience of the foster is deemed suitable. A dog must be fostered for a minimum of 14 days, and a foster contract committing to this time period must be signed.</p>

<h6>Can I meet a dog I’m interested in adopting?</h6>

<p>Once the form has been filled and house check conducted, you are free to visit the dogs you are interested in adopting.</p>

<h6>Do you also conduct rescues or ABC operations?</h6>

<p>We function as an adoption agency, and therefore we do not conduct rescues as we do not run a shelter or centre. We also have no medical facilities or transportation van. However we will guide you on who to contact and what to do depending on the situation.</p>

<h6> Is sterilization mandatory?</h6>

<p>Sterilization is mandated as per our adoption contract. All shelters we work with also deem sterilization mandatory.</p>

<h6> Do you charge an adoption fee?</h6>

<p>While Paws for a Cause does NOT charge an adoption fee, some of the shelters we work with do charge a nominal amount. We do however function on donations, and would be grateful if anyone chooses to donate!</p>

<h6> If I want to put my dog up for adoption, can I contact you?</h6>

<p>You can contact us on Facebook or through our e-mail ID to discuss the situation with us.</p>

<h6>Are rescuers allowed to be in touch with adopters?</h6>

<p>This depends on the comfort of both the family that is adopting and the rescuer of the dog.</p>

<h6> How long does it take for a dog to find a home?</h6>

<p>We cannot guarantee adoptions within any specific time frame though we try our best to ensure no dog goes without a home for long. Purebred dogs, males, and young indie pups tend to get adopted faster due to breed, gender, and age biases.</p>
